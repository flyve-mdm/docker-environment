# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.${HOST_SERVER_NAME}
    DocumentRoot ${HOMEPATH}

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://glpi-php:9000"
    </FilesMatch>
    <Directory ${HOMEPATH}>
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All

        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
        # New directive needed in Apache 2.43 and later
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
